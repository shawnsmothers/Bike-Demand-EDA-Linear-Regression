## Bike Demand Analysis Project 🚴‍♂️📊

### Overview
The Bike Demand Analysis Project is a comprehensive data analysis initiative aimed at understanding the key factors influencing bike rental demand. Utilizing historical rental data, we explore various patterns and correlations, including time-based demand trends, weather impacts, seasonality, and the effect of holidays and working days. The project also incorporates a Linear Regression Model to predict future bike demand based on identified key factors.

### Project Highlights
Data Analysis and Visualization:

In-depth analysis of bike rental demand trends by year, month, hour, season, and weather conditions.
Visualizations to explore relationships between demand and various factors like temperature, humidity, holidays, and working days.
Key Insights:

Seasonality: Fall and Summer exhibit the highest rental demand; Spring shows the lowest.
Daily Patterns: Peak rental hours occur during morning and evening commute times.
Weather Effects: Moderate temperatures and humidity levels are associated with higher demand.
Holiday and Working Day Impact: Slightly lower demand on holidays; marginally higher demand on non-working days.
Machine Learning Model:
